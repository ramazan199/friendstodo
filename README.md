# friendstodo
social network for sharing ToDo list(created with Django)
FriendsToDos is a simple experimental project- social network where users can create their to-do lists. I have developed it using Django web framework (Language: Python) to demonstrate such features as sign up(registration with confirmation email), login, logout, users feed (like news feed of Facebook), usersâ€™ list, ability to visit other users profiles and follow/unfollow them.
